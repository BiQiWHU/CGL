## Relation to the Existing Million-AID dataset 

Million-AID dataset has about one million aerial scene samples from high-resolution satellite images from a variety of imaging sensors (e.g., worldview-2, Gaofen-2, and etc.) in total, but most of the samples in million-AID are annotated automatically or semi-automatically, i.e., without human-level supervision.

Besides, only about 10,000 samples have the publicly-available ground truth, which poses a bottleneck on the amount of training data.

## Fine-grained Land-Cover Dataset (FGLCD) Overview

This is the first dataset for the task of fine-grained land-cover scene classification. Different from conventional remote sensing scene classification datasets, such as ```UCM```, ```AID``` and ```NWPU```, the
